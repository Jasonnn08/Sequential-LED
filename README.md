# 🔁 Arduino Sequential LED Project

This Arduino project, coded in **C++**, creates a **sequential LED lighting effect**, where LEDs light up **one after the other** in a smooth and looping pattern. 

---

## 🔧 How It Works

- Multiple **LEDs are connected** to digital pins on the Arduino.
- The Arduino sketch turns each LED **on and off in sequence**, creating a wave or chasing light effect.
- After the last LED turns off, the sequence **repeats** from the beginning.

This project mimics the effect used in **turn signals**, **running lights**, or **light shows**.

## 🧰 Hardware Used

- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- 3 LEDs 
- Resistors (220–330 ohms for each LED)

---

## 🖥️ Software Requirements

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔁 LEDs light up **in order**, one at a time
- ⏱️ Adjustable **delay** between steps for speed control
- 🔄 Looping animation continues indefinitely

---

## 💡 Notes

- You can change the **number of LEDs**, **sequence direction**, or **speed** by editing the Arduino code.
